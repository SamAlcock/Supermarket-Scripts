# Procedurally Generating Supermarket
This project was made to create unique VR search environments for the Spatial Behaviour Lab at University of Plymouth. The environment is designed for a 6x6m room, which is the size of the Psychology VR lab. However this can
be altered for bigger/smaller rooms. Unfortunately, a fully functioning project cannot be provided here due to the use of paid assets but the code is provided.
